QuotePro Extension Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2025-09-30

The QuotePro Extension (“the Extension”) does not collect, transmit, or sell any user data. All processing occurs locally within your browser.

Data the Extension Can Access
Targeted QuotePro Fields

The Extension reads and writes only the fields on the specific QuotePro billing page where you use the Import Quote feature.

Optional Imported Data

If configured, the Extension retrieves JSON from user-defined API endpoints when you click Import Quote.
This information is used solely to prefill QuotePro fields and is never executed as code.

Data Stored by the Extension

The following information is stored locally on your device (via chrome.storage.local):

User-configured API URLs and optional API token

Feature toggles (e.g., notes annotation, auto-display issues)

The most recent import summary used in the Report view

The Extension uses no analytics and shares no data with third parties.

What the Extension Does Not Collect

The Extension does not collect:

Personal identity information

Health data

Financial or payment information

Authentication credentials (other than an optional API token stored locally by the user)

Personal messages or communications

Location data

Web browsing history

User interaction telemetry (keystrokes, mouse movement, etc.)

Website content outside the specific QuotePro billing page where the tool is actively used

Security

Any network requests (if enabled) are restricted to API endpoints explicitly configured by the user.

Host permissions follow a least-privilege model and are requested only when necessary.

The Extension does not load or execute remote code; all scripts are included in the packaged extension.

User Controls

You can remove all stored settings at any time by uninstalling the Extension or clearing its saved extension data.
You may also revoke site permissions through your browser’s extension settings.
